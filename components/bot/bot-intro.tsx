          The Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model is a strategic approach for companies looking to establish offshore
          operations or development centers with minimal risk and maximum control. EZEU acts as your trusted partner,
          handling the entire setup and initial operation of your dedicated team or facility, before seamlessly
          transferring it to your full ownership.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed italic">
          This model is ideal for long-term engagements, allowing you to leverage global talent pools and cost
          efficiencies without the immediate complexities of setting up an international entity.
